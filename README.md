# TriviaApp

This is the toy app for lesson 3 of the [Android App Development in Kotlin course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012).

The Android Trivia application is an application that asks the user trivia questions about Android development.  It makes use of the Navigation component within Jetpack to move the user between different screens.  Each screen is implemented as a Fragment.
The app navigates using buttons, the Action Bar, and the Navigation Drawer.

## Extra Info

I mostly followed the tutorial, with some very minor changes. In the future I may come back and alter this small project to use in a more complicated app, but for now I am trying to focus on getting the basics instead of spending time trying to make this my own. Once I finish the course I will begin writing an app on my own (or possibly with others, if I can find some collaborators), but for now I'm only on lesson 3 of 10 and am trying to keep up with my University classes at the same time, so I'm mostly just following what's given in the Udacity lessons.
